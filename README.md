# Simple Memory Game in Python
The Simple Memory Game is a Python-based project designed to test and enhance memory skills. In this game, a grid of tiles (each representing an image or symbol) is displayed face-down. Players take turns flipping two tiles at a time. If the flipped tiles match, they are removed; otherwise, they are flipped back face-down. The objective is to uncover all matching pairs by remembering the positions of the tiles. It’s a fun and engaging way to challenge memory and concentration! 🧠🎮🐍
